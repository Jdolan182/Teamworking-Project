/**
 * This represents a hypothetical clock set to produce a "new day" signal every midnight. In this emulation the signal can be triggered by a simple button all by itself in a Frame.
 * The uses made of this timing signal are described in the Timer use case diagram (hyperlinked from this class).
 * There will only be a single instance of this class. It will maintain a current Date object, incremented with each new day. The interface will always show the current date.
